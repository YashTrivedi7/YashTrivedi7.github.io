										<!--I have always loved playing and watching sports, especially football. I was in a tennis and a badminton club for short time. Right now I enjoy playing Cricket and recently joined a club. I am really into health and fitness, enjoy listening to podcasts and audiobooks on this topic. After a long work day, I like to reward myself with some cooking which gives diversity from the daily routine and watch sports or a movie along with it. Whenever I get a long break I like to travel to different countries and explore new cultures, engage with locals and the most important is, try regional foods. I am obsessed with Spain, there is something in the air of that country that attracts me and my wallet every time.  -->
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/IMG_6943.jpg" alt="" /></span><p>My favorite things to do is cook, eat and do fitness. The last one is required after the second, but thankfully I enjoy doing both. As someone famous once said: "Perfectly balanced, as all things should be." On cold, rainy autumn days and snowy winter days I enjoy sitting down with a warm cup of hot chocolate, a nice book and start reading. Most of my friends are into self development books, which I am not a huge fan of, as in my opinion, most self development book focus on telling you what the right thing to do is, however, story books do a better job at it, as you have a chance to dive in with a characters story, emotionaly invest yourself with it, see all the bad decsions taken and see the consequences it has. I feel this makes you learn more. I love exploring new countries and learn about different cultures. I feel travelling opens a different dimension within you, especially learning how things work in a different country and using those to form new habits to improve your life.
